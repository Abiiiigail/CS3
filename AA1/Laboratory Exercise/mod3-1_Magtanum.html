		<p> I had a lot of trouble completing this exercise. It is definitely more difficult than the previous ones we had. To get one thing right, it took me a lot of trial and error, and the same is true for every part of this exercise. I was really helped by the notes and lessons that were added to Khub, but I also had to look for ways to use every element correctly and in its intended way online.</p>
